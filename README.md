# django-collectd-rest

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matwey/django-collectd-rest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matwey/django-collectd-rest)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/django-collectd-rest.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/django-collectd-rest)

django-collectd-rest is a simple [Django] application to demonstrate RRD plots generated by [collectd] or any other [rrd] data. The application is built on top of [django-rest-framework] and provides REST API to access the plots.

There are two major things in django-collectd-rest, *graphs* are grouped into *groups*. Both the graphs and the groups are accessible through REST API. Using mutable access (POST, PUT, DELETE), you can configure you hierarchy, create new graphs or alter existing ones. You also can grab meta-info or ready PNG images by means of GET requests. Genuine ```rrdtool``` is currently used to render the plots.

Newly introduced *granularity* object is a kind of policy hinting image freshness lifetime, or its time resolution. Currently, it is used to correctly set `max-age` in response `Cache-Control` header. The default granularity has `max-age=0`.

## Installation

The following prerequisites are required to operate django-collectd-rest:
* [django-rest-framework] - powerful and flexible toolkit that makes it easy to build Web APIs.
* [rrd] - high performance data logging and graphing system for time series data.

To use django-collectd-rest in your django project, include the following code into your ```settings.py```:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = (
     #...
    'rest_framework',
    'collectd_rest',
)
```

Into your ```urls.py``` you have to add the following:
```
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    #...
    url(r'^collectd_rest/', include('collectd_rest.urls')),
)
```

## Configuration
The whole configuration is stored into the project database, there is not separate dedicated configfile. New graphs and groups are added by creating new objects. The latter can be done in different ways.

Using django database console:
```
from collectd_rest import models
group = models.GraphGroup(title="The Group", name="group1")
group.save()
graph = models.Graph(title="The Graph", name="graph1", priority=0, command="DEF:cpuuser=/path/to/rrd/cpu-0/cpu-idle.rrd:value:AVERAGE LINE2:cpuuser#000000:legend", group=group)
graph.save()
```

The ```GraphGroup``` model has two parameters: human-readable ```title``` and lookup field ```name``` to access the group by url like ```http://example.com/collectd_rest/group/{name}/```.
The ```Graph``` model has way more fields, including ```priority``` to sort the graphs inside one group, mandatory parent ```group```, and ```command``` to generate rrd plot.

The other ways to configure the application are Django fixtures, Django admin interface, [django-rest-framework] web browsable interface, and REST API itself. You can also modify the graphs hierarchy dynamically by means of custom REST client.

## Authentication and permissions
You may utilise all possible options provided by [django-rest-framework]. See [Tutorial](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/4-authentication-and-permissions/) for reference.

## Caching
You may utilise all caching mechanisms provided by [Django] framework. See [Django's cache framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/).

## Using
To demonstrate how the framework can be used, let's look at the following JavaScript code ([jQuery] is used here). The following code renders the group names ```mygroup``` into corresponding ```div``` element, and the ```myothergroup``` into the other one.
```
<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://yastatic.net/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.js"></script>
<script>
function renderGraph(graph) {
        var name  = graph['name'];
        var title = graph['title'];
        var url   = graph['url'];
        
        var code = "<div id=\"" + name + "\" class=\"django-collectd-rest-graph\">\n";
        code += "<div>" + title + "</div>\n";
        code += "<img src=" + url + " />\n";
        code += "</div>\n";
        return code;
};
function renderGroup(group) {
        var name  = group['name'];
        var title = group['title'];
        var graphs= group['graphs'];
        
        var code = "<div>" + title + "</div><ul>\n";
        graphs.forEach(function(g){
                code += "<li>" + renderGraph(g) + "</li>\n";
        });
        code += "</ul>\n";
        return code;
}

$(document).ready(function(){

        $.get( "http://example.com/collectd_rest/groups/", function( data ) {
                data.forEach(function(entry) {
                        var name = entry['name'];
                        var code = renderGroup(entry);
                        $(".django-collectd-rest-group#" + name).html(code);
                });
        });

});
</script>
</head>
<body>
<div id="test">
</div>
<div class="django-collectd-rest-group" id="mygroup"></div>
<div class="django-collectd-rest-group" id="myothergroup"></div>
</body>
</html>
```
